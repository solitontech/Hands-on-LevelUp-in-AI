---

## 3. Model Usage & Limits
1. Know accessible models and when to use each ([Learn about OpenAI Models](https://github.com/solitontech/Hands-on-LevelUp-in-AI/blob/main/openai_bytes/01_understanding_openai_models.ipynb))  
2. Understand rate limits (RPM, TPM) ([Handle Rate Limits Effectively](https://github.com/solitontech/Hands-on-LevelUp-in-AI/blob/main/openai_bytes/04_rate_limits_with_responses.ipynb))  
3. Know model token costs and budgeting ([Optimize Token Costs](https://github.com/solitontech/Hands-on-LevelUp-in-AI/blob/main/openai_bytes/04_rate_limits_with_responses.ipynb))  
4. Able to choose the right model using reasoning or LLM help ([Choosing the Right Model](https://github.com/solitontech/Hands-on-LevelUp-in-AI/blob/main/openai_bytes/01_understanding_openai_models.ipynb))  
5. Track usage, limits, and spending in the OpenAI dashboard ([Monitor Usage and Spending](https://platform.openai.com/usage))  

---

## 4. Bot Logic & Game Flow
1. Know how to maintain full game history/state in memory  
2. Produce structured, formatted responses reliably  
3. Implement fallback logic for slow LLM responses  
4. Implement detailed logs for all bot actions  
5. Debug, trace, and recover gracefully from runtime issues  

---

## 5. Honor Code
1. Play fair — use the system creatively to learn and have fun.  
2. Use only the officially provided SPL models during the event.  
3. You may use web search, free generative AI tools, and open-source tools.  
4. You may not use paid tools or subscriptions (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT Plus).  
5. Declare all tools in the Gen AI Tools Declaration sheet.  
6. Keep your API key private — do not share it with anyone.  
7. During pre-SPL, openly share ideas, learnings, and code snippets.  
8. Develop your own work — do not copy or reuse someone else’s code.  
9. Report any bugs, loopholes, or misuse to organizers immediately.  
10. Uphold integrity and the Soliton spirit throughout SPL.  
11. Respect all final decisions made by organizers.

2. Any open-source libraries/utilities  
3. Web search for clues and reasoning  

### Not Allowed
