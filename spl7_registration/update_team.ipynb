    "\n",
    "The SPL API Key is your unique identifier that authenticates your requests to the SPL Server. Follow these steps carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Your API Key:\n",
    "1. Visit the SPL platform: https://spl7.solitontech.ai/\n",
    "2. Log in with your Soliton account credentials\n",
    "3. Navigate to the **API KEY** section in the top-right corner of the navigation bar\n",
    "4. Click the **Get API Key** button\n",
    "5. Your personal API key will be generated - keep this window open\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuring Your Environment:\n",
    "1. Look for the `.env.example` file in your project directory\n",
    "2. Create a copy of this file and rename it to `.env` (exactly as shown, with the dot)\n",
    "3. Open your new `.env` file in a text editor\n",
    "4. Replace the placeholder value with your actual API Key\n",
    "5. Save the `.env` file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Your API Key:\n",
    "1. Run the code cell below to load your API Key into the environment\n",
    "2. **IMPORTANT**: If you modify your `.env` file later, you must re-run this cell\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Security Warning**\n",
    "- Your API Key is sensitive information - never share it with anyone\n",
    "- Do not commit your `.env` file to version control systems\n",
    "- The API Key identifies you personally for all API requests made from your notebook"

    "\n",
    "1. You will need your **team ID** from your original registration response\n",

    "3. Replace all placeholder text with your updated information:\n",
    "   - Add your team ID in the `team_id` field\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Update Permissions:**\n",
    "   - Only the original team creator (owner of the API key used for registration) can update the team\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Same Validation Rules Apply:**\n",
    "   - Team name must remain unique\n",
    "   - Only valid Soliton email addresses\n",
    "   - Exactly 2 participants per team\n",
    "   - At least one participant must be in Coimbatore\n",
    "   - The API key owner must remain as a participant\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verification:**\n",
    "   - After updating, verify the changes in the response\n",
    "   - All team members will be notified of the changes automatically"
