    "Welcome back, SPL warriors! 💪  \n",
    "Sometimes, things change — you may realize your teammate doesn’t code the same way you do (or maybe they don’t code at all 😅).  \n",
    "Or perhaps you just want to rebrand your team with a cooler name. Whatever the reason, it’s **totally fine** — this notebook is here to help you update your team details easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can update your team **until the official update deadline**, so go ahead and make those tweaks.  \n",
    "Whether it’s a new team name, a changed tech stack, or a swapped-out teammate — you can handle it all right here.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll go through this in **two simple steps**:  \n",
    "1. **Set up your environment** – same as before (you’ll need your API key).  \n",
    "2. **Update your team info** – enter your team ID and make the changes you need.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive in and make those updates happen. 🧠⚙️  \n"

    "The SPL API Key is your unique identifier that authenticates your requests to the SPL Server. Follow these steps carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Your API Key:\n",
    "1. Visit the SPL platform: https://spl7.solitontech.ai/\n",
    "2. Log in with your Soliton account credentials\n",
    "3. Navigate to the **API KEY** section in the top-right corner of the navigation bar\n",
    "4. Click the **Get API Key** button\n",
    "5. Your personal API key will be generated - keep this window open\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuring Your Environment:\n",
    "1. Look for the `.env.example` file in your project directory\n",
    "2. Create a copy of this file and rename it to `.env` (exactly as shown, with the dot)\n",
    "3. Open your new `.env` file in a text editor\n",
    "4. Replace the placeholder value with your actual API Key\n",
    "5. Save the `.env` file\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Your API Key:\n",
    "1. Run the code cell below to load your API Key into the environment\n",
    "2. **IMPORTANT**: If you modify your `.env` file later, you must re-run this cell\n",
    "\n",
    "**⚠️ Security Warning**\n",
    "- Your API Key is sensitive information - never share it with anyone\n",
    "- Do not commit your `.env` file to version control systems\n",
