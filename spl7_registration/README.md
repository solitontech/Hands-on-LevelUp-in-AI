# 🎉SPL Season7 Registration is HERE!

Welcome to the Soliton Premier League Season 7 registration process! This year, we're doing something different — you'll register your team by **running code** rather than filling out forms!

> 🔧 **New to SPL?** Haven't set up the repository yet? Check out the [setup_instructions.md](../setup_instructions.md) to quickly get yourself comfortable with the workspace.
> **No Prerequisites Needed** — Don't worry about completing Week 1 or Week 2 content before registering. Jump right in and learn at your own pace! The learning materials are there to help you, not block you 🧠✨

### 📋 Set Up For Success

- 🚀 **The SPL Way:** Follow the [setup instructions](../setup_instructions.md) to clone the repository properly. You'll get a fully configured environment with all dependencies working seamlessly. Plus, you can easily pull updates as SPL evolves!

- ⚠️ **Avoid Pitfalls:** While downloading the repository as a ZIP might seem like a shortcut, it often leads to missing dependencies, configuration headaches, and update difficulties. Trust us — the extra minute spent on proper Git setup saves hours of troubleshooting later!

## 🔍 What's in this folder?

- [**`register_team.ipynb`**](./register_team.ipynb) — Your gateway to joining SPL Season 7!
- [**`update_team.ipynb`**](./update_team.ipynb) — For making changes after registration
- **client.py** (⚠️ **DO NOT MODIFY**) — The behind-the-scenes magic Season 7 

## 🤝 Team Registration

Your team's journey begins here! The [**registration notebook**](./register_team.ipynb) guides you through:

- Setting up your SPL API key
- Picking your team name (make it creative!)
- Adding your teammate

After registering, you'll receive a confirmation email from **spl@solitontech.com** with all the details.

## 🔄 Need to Update Your Team?

Things change! If you need to modify your team info, the [**update notebook**](./update_team.ipynb) lets you:

- Change your team name
- Replace your teammate
- Update your tech stack or location

Just remember to have your Team ID handy from the registration step.
