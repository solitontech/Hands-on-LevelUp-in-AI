<a id="key-principles"></a>
## üí° Key Prompting Principles to Remember

1. **Be Specific and Clear**
   - Vague prompts lead to vague results
   - Provide context and constraints
   - Use examples when possible (few-shot learning)

2. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Your first prompt is rarely your best prompt
   - Test and refine based on outputs
   - Keep track of what works

3. **Structure Your Prompts**
   - Use delimiters to separate instructions from content
   - Break complex tasks into steps
   - Specify the desired format of the output

4. **Give the Model Time to "Think"**
   - For complex reasoning, ask the model to work step-by-step
   - Use chain-of-thought prompting
   - Request explanations before final answers

5. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Consider what might go wrong
   - Add constraints to prevent unwanted outputs
   - Ask the model to verify its work

<a id="practical-exercises"></a>
## üî® Practical Exercise Ideas

After completing the learning resources, try these exercises:

1. **Summarization Challenge**
   - Take a long article and create prompts to summarize it at different lengths
   - Compare results with different prompting techniques

2. **Role-Playing Scenarios**
   - Create prompts where the AI takes on different expert roles
   - Compare how the persona affects the response quality

3. **Code Generation**
   - Write prompts to generate Python code for specific tasks
   - Refine prompts to get more efficient or better-documented code

4. **Creative Writing**
   - Experiment with temperature settings for creative vs. factual content
   - Use few-shot examples to establish a specific writing style

5. **Information Extraction**
   - Create prompts to extract structured data from unstructured text
   - Practice using output formatting instructions

Here are some examples:

Example 1:
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]

Example 2:
Input: [example input]
Output: [example output]

Now, please process this:
Input: [your actual input]
Output:
```

### Chain-of-Thought Template
```
Problem: [State the problem]

Let's solve this step by step:
1. [Ask the model to identify the first step]
2. [Ask the model to proceed with analysis]
3. [Ask for the final answer]

Please show your reasoning for each step.
```
