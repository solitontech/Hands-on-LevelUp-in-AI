    "## Key Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What are Tokens?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens are the energy units your models spend when they speak or think. They’re pieces of words the model processes—imagine syllables or fragments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- \"Hello\" = 1 token\n",
    "- \"ChatGPT is amazing!\" = 5 tokens\n",
    "- \"OpenAI's GPT-4o model\" = 7 tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Energy isn’t infinite. More tokens = higher cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** 1 token ≈ 4 characters or ≈ 0.75 words in English\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Prompting and Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "- For best results, learn how to write effective prompts: [OpenAI Prompting Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompting)\n",
    "- For deeper understanding of how models reason, see: [OpenAI Reasoning Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning)\n",

    "- `system` sets the overall persona or guardrails (the director’s notes).\n",
    "- `user` captures each question or instruction you send (the live prompt).\n",
