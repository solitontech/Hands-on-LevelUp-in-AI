# Byte #1: Understanding OpenAI Models 🧠

**⏱️ Time to Complete: 5-10 minutes**

## What Are These Models?

Think of AI models as different brains - each with unique strengths, speeds, and capabilities. Choosing the right model is like picking the right tool for the job!

## The Five OpenAI Models Compared

| Model           | Speed         | Cost         | Best For                          | Max Tokens | Reasoning Ability |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **GPT 5-nano** | ⚡⚡⚡⚡ Very Fast | 💰 Very Low  | Quick, low-cost tasks            | 16K        | Basic             |
| **GPT 5-mini** | ⚡⚡⚡ Fast      | 💰 Low       | Balanced speed and quality       | 32K        | Good              |
| **GPT 4.1-mini** | ⚡⚡ Moderate  | 💰💰 Medium  | Moderate reasoning, coding tasks | 64K        | Very Good         |
| **GPT 4o**     | ⚡ Moderate    | 💰💰 Medium  | General-purpose, long contexts   | 128K       | Good              |
| **GPT 4.1**    | ⚡ Slower      | 💰💰💰 High   | Advanced reasoning, detailed tasks | 128K       | Excellent         |

## Key Concepts Explained

### 🔹 What are Tokens?

Tokens are pieces of words that the model processes. Think of them as syllables or word fragments.

**Examples:**
- "Hello" = 1 token
- "ChatGPT is amazing!" = 5 tokens
- "OpenAI's GPT-4o model" = 7 tokens

**Why it matters:** You pay per token! More tokens = higher cost.

**Rule of thumb:** 1 token ≈ 4 characters or ≈ 0.75 words in English

### 🔹 What is Reasoning?

Reasoning models (like o1-preview and o1-mini) actually "think through" problems step-by-step before answering, similar to how humans solve complex problems.

**Example:**
- **Regular model:** Gives quick answer
- **Reasoning model:** Shows its work: "Let me break this down... First, I'll analyze X... Then consider Y... Therefore, the answer is Z"

### 🔹 When to Use Each Model

```python
# Quick customer service chatbot
use = "gpt-4o-mini"  # Fast + cheap

# Content generation, general assistant
use = "gpt-4o"  # Balanced speed and quality

# Complex math problem or algorithm design
use = "o1-preview"  # Best reasoning

# Coding challenges, data analysis
use = "o1-mini"  # Good reasoning, lower cost

# Long documents with detailed analysis
use = "gpt-4-turbo"  # Large context window
```

## Quick Code Sample: Checking Model Info

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="your-api-key-here")

# List all available models
models = client.models.list()

# Print model IDs
for model in models.data:
    print(f"Model: {model.id}")
```

## 💡 Quick Decision Guide

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Is it simple?** → Use `gpt-4o-mini` (cheapest, fastest)
2. **Is it complex reasoning?** → Use `o1-preview` or `o1-mini`
3. **Need balance?** → Use `gpt-4o` (good all-rounder)
4. **Long documents?** → Use `gpt-4-turbo`

## Cost Example (Approximate)

Let's say you process 1 million tokens:

| Model  | Input Cost (per 1M tokens) | Output Cost (per 1M tokens) | Total (≈1M tokens)|
|---|---|---|---|
| **GPT 5-nano** | **$0.05** | **$0.40** | ~$0.45 
| **GPT 5-mini** | **$0.25** | **$2.00** | ~$2.25 
| **GPT 4.1-mini** | **$0.40** | **$1.60** | ~$2.00 | From OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 pricing. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| **GPT 4o** | **$5.00** | **$15.00** | ~$20.00 |
| **GPT 4.1** | **$2.00** | **$8.00** | ~$10.00

## ✅ Your Task

Create a comparison table with these criteria:
- Which model would you use for a chatbot?
- Which for solving calculus problems?
- Which for summarizing short emails?
- Which for analyzing a 50-page legal document?

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

✓ Different models = different strengths  
✓ Tokens = cost units (think "word pieces")  
✓ Reasoning models "think" step-by-step  
✓ Choose based on task complexity and budget
