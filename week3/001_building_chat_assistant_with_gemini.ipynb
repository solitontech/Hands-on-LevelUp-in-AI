    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 3 of our Python development series! This week, we're diving into the exciting world of Large Language Models (LLMs) by building our own AI assistant using Google's Gemini API. By the end of this session, you'll have created your own AI assistant and gained valuable insights into how modern AI systems work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Superhero Sidekick Metaphor**: Throughout this notebook, we'll compare working with LLMs to having your own superhero AI sidekick:\n",
    "- The LLM is like your superhero sidekick with encyclopedic knowledge and special powers\n",
    "- Prompts are like mission briefings you give to your sidekick\n",
    "- API parameters are like special equipment you provide (e.g., \"be more creative\" or \"stay focused\")\n",
    "- The sidekick's responses are the intelligence and assistance they provide for your mission\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "1. Understanding Large Language Models and Google's Gemini\n",
    "2. Setting up your API credentials securely\n",
    "3. Making requests to the Gemini API\n",
    "4. Customizing responses with different parameters\n",
    "5. Building a simple chatbot with persistent history\n",

    "## 1. Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start using the Gemini API, we need to set up our environment properly. This includes adding our API key to the `.env` file and installing the necessary packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Required Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up your environment for using the Gemini API, you'll need to install the necessary packages. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal window in VS Code (Terminal → New Terminal)\n",
    "2. Navigate to the project root directory (where the `pyproject.toml` file is located)\n",
    "3. Run the following command to install all project dependencies using UV:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   uv pip install -e .\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This command installs the project in \"editable\" mode, allowing you to modify the code without reinstalling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install the Google Generative AI library (if it's not already in the project dependencies):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   uv pip install google-generativeai\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can also check for the latest versions of packages and update them:\n",

    "7. Click on the created API key you created from the table, copy the API key (Starts with `AI`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, add your API key to the existing `.env` file in the project root directory by adding these lines:\n",
    "```\n",
    "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here\n",
    "GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash\n",

      "Question: What scientific principles does Black Panther's vibranium technology use?\n",
      "\n",
      "Gemini: Black Panther's vibranium technology is arguably the most advanced on Earth within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, pushing the boundaries of what we understand about material science, energy, and information technology. While fictional, it operates on fascinating (and often speculative) scientific principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Kinetic Energy Manipulation (Absorption, Storage, and Redirection):**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** This is vibranium's most famous and fundamental property. It doesn't just absorb energy; it **stores** it and can then **release** or **redirect** it.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **Black Panther's Suit:** The most prominent example. Impacts, bullets, explosions – all kinetic energy is absorbed by the suit's vibranium weave. This energy is stored within the suit's internal matrix and can then be discharged as concussive blasts (the purple energy wave).\n",
      "        *   **Shields & Defenses:** Wakandan shields (like those around their cities or used by Dora Milaje) absorb kinetic force, preventing damage.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** Imagine a material that can precisely control the propagation of mechanical waves (impacts). It would likely involve a unique atomic lattice structure that can deform and return to its original state with incredible efficiency, converting kinetic energy into a different, storable form (perhaps elastic potential energy at a subatomic level, or even a localized electromagnetic field). It acts like a super-efficient, programmable spring or capacitor for kinetic energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Material Science (Super-Strength, Lightweight, and Nanotechnology):**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** Vibranium is incredibly strong, durable, and lightweight. Wakandans have mastered its manipulation at a molecular and even atomic level.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **The Panther Habit (Suit):** The suit is woven from vibranium. In *Black Panther* (2018) and *Infinity War*, it's shown to be made of nanites stored in his necklace, which self-assemble and disassemble around his body. This is a profound application of **nanotechnology** and **programmable matter**.\n",
      "        *   **Wakandan Infrastructure:** Their buildings, vehicles (like the Maglev trains), and even tools benefit from vibranium's strength and low mass.\n",
      "        *   **Weapons:** The Dora Milaje's spears, for example, are made of vibranium, allowing them to be both incredibly sharp and resilient.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This points to an incredibly stable and strong atomic bonding structure, possibly with unique electron configurations that give it its properties. The nanite suit indicates **molecular manufacturing**, where individual atoms or molecules are precisely arranged to create complex structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Energy Generation & Manipulation (Beyond Kinetic):**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** While it absorbs kinetic energy, vibranium appears to be a conduit or catalyst for other forms of energy as well, potentially even drawing ambient energy.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **Kimoyo Beads:** These seemingly simple beads are supercomputers, communicators, and holographic projectors, all powered by what appears to be incredibly efficient, compact vibranium power sources.\n",
      "        *   **Wakandan Tech in General:** Their advanced technology requires vast amounts of energy, likely generated through highly efficient vibranium-based systems, perhaps even harnessing energy from the vibranium mound itself or through novel conversion processes.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This suggests vibranium might have unique electromagnetic properties, perhaps acting as a super-efficient transducer, converting various forms of energy (thermal, light, even exotic forms) into usable electrical or other forms, or even facilitating a form of contained cold fusion or zero-point energy generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Advanced Computing & Information Technology:**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** Wakandans use vibranium to create unparalleled computing power, communication networks, and holographic interfaces.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **Kimoyo Beads:** As mentioned, they perform complex calculations, real-time data analysis, medical diagnostics, and secure communication, all with a visually intuitive holographic interface.\n",
      "        *   **Wakandan AI and Networks:** Their entire society is integrated with highly advanced AI and computing networks, far surpassing global standards.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This could imply vibranium-based **quantum computing**, vastly more powerful than silicon-based systems, allowing for instantaneous processing, secure encryption, and holographic projection with unprecedented fidelity. Its unique properties might allow for incredibly dense information storage and rapid data transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Acoustic/Sonic Manipulation:**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** Vibranium can be tuned to absorb or project specific sound frequencies, sometimes with devastating effects.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **Killmonger's Suit:** Features sonic pulses, demonstrating vibranium's ability to manipulate sound waves for offensive purposes.\n",
      "        *   **Sonic Stabilizers:** Some Wakandan technology uses sonic frequencies for stability or propulsion.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This involves **acoustics** and **wave physics** at an extreme level. Vibranium could be designed to resonate at specific frequencies, either absorbing sound waves to create silence or generating powerful, focused sound waves for concussive force or specific effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Wakandan vibranium technology leverages a fictional material with properties that stretch our understanding of physics. It acts as a super-material for kinetic energy, a foundation for nanotechnology and programmable matter, a versatile energy conduit/source, and a basis for hyper-advanced computing and acoustic manipulation. T'Challa, Shuri, and the Wakandan scientists have mastered applying these principles to create a utopian society.\n",

      "        *   **Wakandan Infrastructure:** Their buildings, vehicles (like the Maglev trains), and even tools benefit from vibranium's strength and low mass.\n",
      "        *   **Weapons:** The Dora Milaje's spears, for example, are made of vibranium, allowing them to be both incredibly sharp and resilient.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This points to an incredibly stable and strong atomic bonding structure, possibly with unique electron configurations that give it its properties. The nanite suit indicates **molecular manufacturing**, where individual atoms or molecules are precisely arranged to create complex structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Energy Generation & Manipulation (Beyond Kinetic):**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** While it absorbs kinetic energy, vibranium appears to be a conduit or catalyst for other forms of energy as well, potentially even drawing ambient energy.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **Kimoyo Beads:** These seemingly simple beads are supercomputers, communicators, and holographic projectors, all powered by what appears to be incredibly efficient, compact vibranium power sources.\n",
      "        *   **Wakandan Tech in General:** Their advanced technology requires vast amounts of energy, likely generated through highly efficient vibranium-based systems, perhaps even harnessing energy from the vibranium mound itself or through novel conversion processes.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This suggests vibranium might have unique electromagnetic properties, perhaps acting as a super-efficient transducer, converting various forms of energy (thermal, light, even exotic forms) into usable electrical or other forms, or even facilitating a form of contained cold fusion or zero-point energy generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Advanced Computing & Information Technology:**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** Wakandans use vibranium to create unparalleled computing power, communication networks, and holographic interfaces.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **Kimoyo Beads:** As mentioned, they perform complex calculations, real-time data analysis, medical diagnostics, and secure communication, all with a visually intuitive holographic interface.\n",
      "        *   **Wakandan AI and Networks:** Their entire society is integrated with highly advanced AI and computing networks, far surpassing global standards.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This could imply vibranium-based **quantum computing**, vastly more powerful than silicon-based systems, allowing for instantaneous processing, secure encryption, and holographic projection with unprecedented fidelity. Its unique properties might allow for incredibly dense information storage and rapid data transfer.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Acoustic/Sonic Manipulation:**\n",
      "    *   **Principle:** Vibranium can be tuned to absorb or project specific sound frequencies, sometimes with devastating effects.\n",
      "    *   **Application:**\n",
      "        *   **Killmonger's Suit:** Features sonic pulses, demonstrating vibranium's ability to manipulate sound waves for offensive purposes.\n",
      "        *   **Sonic Stabilizers:** Some Wakandan technology uses sonic frequencies for stability or propulsion.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Concept:** This involves **acoustics** and **wave physics** at an extreme level. Vibranium could be designed to resonate at specific frequencies, either absorbing sound waves to create silence or generating powerful, focused sound waves for concussive force or specific effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Wakandan vibranium technology leverages a fictional material with properties that stretch our understanding of physics. It acts as a super-material for kinetic energy, a foundation for nanotechnology and programmable matter, a versatile energy conduit/source, and a basis for hyper-advanced computing and acoustic manipulation. T'Challa, Shuri, and the Wakandan scientists have mastered applying these principles to create a utopian society.\n"
