# Large Language Models (LLMs) Learning Resources

Welcome to Week 3 of our Python for Learning AI series! In this week, we'll be diving deep into Large Language Models (LLMs) and how to interact with them through APIs. This document provides curated video resources to help you understand key concepts about LLMs before diving into our hands-on notebook exercises.

## Understanding the Fundamentals

While we'll be using Google's Gemini API in our practical exercises, many of the core concepts apply to all LLMs including those from OpenAI (like GPT models). Having a strong foundation in these concepts will help you work effectively with any LLM platform.

## Learning Path

We recommend watching these videos in the order presented:

### 1. What are Large Language Models? 
A beginner-friendly introduction to LLMs and how they work at a high level.

### 2. How Models Like ChatGPT Work
Understand the technical details of pre-training, reinforcement learning, and practical examples of LLMs in action.

### 3. Understanding Tokens in LLMs
Learn about tokens - the building blocks of how LLMs process text input and generate output.

### 4. Context Windows in LLMs
Discover how context windows determine how much information an LLM can "remember" during a conversation.

## Practical Application

After reviewing these resources, you'll be well-prepared for our practical notebook exercises where we'll be using **Google's Gemini API**. While the concepts you learn from these videos largely focus on OpenAI models, the principles apply across different LLM platforms, and you'll be able to apply this knowledge when working with Gemini.

The Gemini API offers similar capabilities to OpenAI's models but with its own unique strengths and characteristics. Our notebook will guide you through setting up the Gemini API, making basic requests, and building more complex applications like chatbots with memory.

## Why We're Using Gemini

Google's Gemini offers:
- Strong performance across various tasks
- **Free to begin with** - perfect for learning and experimentation
- Easy-to-use API
- Excellent documentation and support
- Competitive pricing for advanced usage

By learning the core concepts of LLMs and then applying them with Gemini, you'll develop skills that are transferable across different LLM platforms in the future.

**Note for SPL Event Participants:** For our official SPL event, we will be using OpenAI's models. We are currently working on finalizing the pricing and access arrangements. The skills you learn with Gemini will transfer seamlessly to working with OpenAI's models.

## The Hidden Treasure Trove üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

**Psst!** Want to know a secret? There's a treasure chest of LLM knowledge that's been hiding in plain sight:
