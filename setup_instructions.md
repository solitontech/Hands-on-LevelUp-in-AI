   - macOS: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal" and press Enter
   - Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` or search for "Terminal" in your applications

```bash
# Install UV using pip
pip install uv

# Verify installation
uv --version
```
**Note**: After installing UV globally, you can use it for any Python project on your system.

## 5. Understanding Virtual Environments

A virtual environment isolates your project dependencies from your system Python. You can use either the traditional venv approach or UV's built-in virtual environment management.

**Note**: The following instructions are general guidelines to help you learn how to create virtual environments.

### Using UV's virtual environment management (after installing UV)

#### Windows
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:
   - Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell" or "Command Prompt"
   - Or search for "cmd" or "powershell" in the Start menu

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd path\to\your\project

# Create a virtual environment with UV
uv venv

# Optional: Specify a Python version 
# uv venv --python C:\Python312\python.exe

# Activate the virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### macOS/Linux
1. Open Terminal:
   - macOS: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal" and press Enter
   - Linux: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` or search for "Terminal" in your applications

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd path/to/your/project

# Create a virtual environment with UV
uv venv

# Optional: Specify a Python version
# uv venv --python python3.12
# Or with full path: uv venv --python /usr/bin/python3.12

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

# Repository/Project Specific Setup

## 1. Cloning the Learning Content Repository

- repository-url - https://github.com/solitontech/SPL-7.git
- repository name - SPL-7


1. Open a terminal:
   - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
   - **macOS/Linux**: Open Terminal

2. Run the following commands:

Replace `[repository-url]` with the actual URL and `[repository-name]` with the actual name of the provided repository provided above.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to the repository folder
cd [repository-name]

# Create a virtual environment with UV
uv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the packages from the pyproject.toml
uv pip install -e .

# To add custom packages (optional)
uv add <package_name>
```

**Note**: You should see your terminal prompt change to indicate that the virtual environment is active. It will typically show `(.venv)` at the beginning of the prompt line.

### Essential Git Commands

Here are the key Git commands you'll use most frequently. Run these in your terminal while inside the repository folder:

1. **git pull**: Update your local repository with the latest learning materials and examples. This is the command you'll use most often to get new content.
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the repository directory
   cd [repository-name]
   
   # Pull the latest changes
   git pull
   ```

2. **git status**: Check if your local repository is up-to-date or if there are new changes available.
   ```bash
   # Open terminal in the repository folder
   git status
   ```

3. **git add**: Stage changes before committing them. This marks which changes you want to include in your next commit.
   ```bash
   # Add a specific file
   git add filename.py
   
   # Add multiple specific files
   git add file1.py file2.py
   
   # Add all files of a specific type
   git add *.py
   
   # Add all changes in the current directory
   git add .
   
   # Add changes interactively (review each change)
   git add -p
   ```

4. **git commit**: Save your changes with a descriptive message. This is essential when you make modifications to the code.
   ```bash
   # Commit the changes you've staged with git add
   git commit -m "Brief description of what you changed"
   
   # Combine add and commit for already tracked files
   git commit -am "Updated existing files"
   ```

5. **git log**: View the history of updates to the learning materials.
   ```bash
   # Open terminal in the repository folder
   # View recent commits
   git log --oneline -n 5
   ```

6. **git checkout**: Switch to specific versions of learning materials or examples if needed.
   ```bash
   # Open terminal in the repository folder
   # Checkout a specific file from the repository
   git checkout origin/main -- path/to/file.py
   ```

7. **VS Code Git GUI**: You can perform many Git operations directly through VS Code's graphical interface without typing commands:
   - View changes in the Source Control tab (icon on the left sidebar)
   - Stage changes by clicking the + icon next to modified files
   - Commit by typing a message and clicking the checkmark icon
   - See diffs by clicking on modified files
   - Pull, push, and manage branches from the three-dot menu (â‹¯)
   - View file history by right-clicking a file and selecting "Git: View File History"

## 2. Running Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code

1. Open VS Code
2. Open the project folder: `File > Open Folder` and select the cloned repository folder
3. Navigate to the `week1` folder in the Explorer view
4. Open `week1_python_basics.ipynb`
5. In the top right corner, click on `Select Kernel` to select the Python interpreter from your virtual environment:

   ![Selecting a kernel in VS Code](week1/images/kernel_selection.png)

6. You can now run cells by clicking the play button to the left of each cell or by pressing `Shift+Enter`

## Troubleshooting

### Python not found
- Make sure Python is added to your PATH
- Try using `python3` instead of `python` on macOS/Linux
- Open a terminal and verify with `python --version` or `python3 --version`

### Jupyter not working
- Make sure you've installed the Jupyter extension for VS Code
- Open a terminal in your project directory with the virtual environment activated and run:
  ```bash
  uv pip install --upgrade jupyter
  ```

### Package installation errors
- Make sure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(.venv)` in your terminal prompt)
- Open a terminal in your project directory and run:
  ```bash
  # Install a specific package
  uv pip install <package-name>
  
  # List installed packages to verify
  pip list
  ```
- If UV is having issues, try reinstalling it from your terminal
- On Windows, you might need Visual C++ build tools for some packages: [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

### UV specific issues
- If UV commands aren't found, open a new terminal and ensure it's properly installed in your PATH
- For dependency conflicts, open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  uv pip install --resolution=highest <package-name>
  ```
