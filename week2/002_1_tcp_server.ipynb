    "### Why Port Communication Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Port communication is foundational to modern computing for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enables Multi-Service Architecture**: Ports allow a single device to run multiple network services simultaneously\n",
    "2. **Service Identification**: Helps identify which application or service should receive incoming data\n",
    "3. **Security Boundary**: Provides a controlled interface for external systems to access specific services\n",
    "4. **Network Troubleshooting**: Essential for diagnosing connectivity issues and network problems\n",
    "5. **Application Development**: Critical knowledge for building distributed applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Port?\n",
    "\n",
    "A port is like a numbered doorway into your computer:\n",
    "- Each port number (0-65535) can be used for different services\n",
    "- Common ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH), 3306 (MySQL)\n",
    "- Multiple applications can listen on different ports\n",
    "- Only one application can use a specific port at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Port Ranges:\n",
    "1. Well-known ports (0-1023)\n",
    "   - Reserved for standard services\n",
    "   - Require administrative privileges\n",
    "   - Examples: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Registered ports (1024-49151)\n",
    "   - Used by applications\n",
    "   - Don't require special privileges\n",
    "   - Good for custom applications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic ports (49152-65535)\n",
    "   - Used for temporary connections\n",
    "   - Available for any purpose\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What servers do**: Listen for and accept client connections\n",
    "2. **How servers work**: Bind to ports and process incoming requests\n",
    "3. **TCP servers**: Handle raw socket connections and data exchange\n",
    "4. **HTTP servers**: Process web requests with standardized methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding server-side programming is essential for AI development as many AI systems are deployed as services that other applications can connect to. Whether you're creating an API for machine learning predictions or deploying a large language model as a service, the concepts covered here provide the foundation for that communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the companion client notebook, you'll learn how to connect to these servers and exchange data with them."
