    "### Why Port Communication Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Port communication is foundational to modern computing for several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enables Multi-Service Architecture**: Ports allow a single device to run multiple network services simultaneously\n",
    "2. **Service Identification**: Helps identify which application or service should receive incoming data\n",
    "3. **Security Boundary**: Provides a controlled interface for external systems to access specific services\n",
    "4. **Network Troubleshooting**: Essential for diagnosing connectivity issues and network problems\n",
    "5. **Application Development**: Critical knowledge for building distributed applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Port?\n",
    "\n",
    "A port is like a numbered doorway into your computer:\n",
    "- Each port number (0-65535) can be used for different services\n",
    "- Common ports: 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH), 3306 (MySQL)\n",
    "- Multiple applications can listen on different ports\n",
    "- Only one application can use a specific port at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Port Ranges:\n",
    "1. Well-known ports (0-1023)\n",
    "   - Reserved for standard services\n",
    "   - Require administrative privileges\n",
    "   - Examples: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Registered ports (1024-49151)\n",
    "   - Used by applications\n",
    "   - Don't require special privileges\n",
    "   - Good for custom applications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dynamic ports (49152-65535)\n",
    "   - Used for temporary connections\n",
    "   - Available for any purpose\n",
    "\n",
