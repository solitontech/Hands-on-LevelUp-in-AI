    "   - Handles potential connection errors (like when the server isn't running)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Exchange**:\n",
    "   - Converts string messages to bytes with `encode('utf-8')` before sending\n",
    "   - Receives response data and converts back to string with `decode('utf-8')`\n",
    "   - Buffers up to 1024 bytes at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cleanup**:\n",
    "   - Uses `finally` block to ensure the socket is always closed\n",
    "   - Prevents resource leaks from lingering connections\n",
