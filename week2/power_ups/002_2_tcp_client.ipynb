    "## Creating a TCP Client\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, let's understand the client's role in network communication:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initiating Connection**: Unlike servers which wait passively, clients actively reach out to establish connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Request-Response Pattern**: Clients typically send a request and wait for the server's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connection Management**: Clients need to properly open and close connections to avoid resource leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Network operations can fail for various reasons, so clients must handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data Formatting**: Clients need to format outgoing data and parse incoming responses correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore the low-level socket communication side (a TCP client). When you're ready for high-level HTTP interactions, continue with [`002_4_http_client.ipynb`](./002_4_http_client.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple client function that can connect to our TCP server from the companion notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our client will:\n",
    "- Establish a connection to the server\n",
    "- Send a message\n",
    "- Receive the response\n",
    "- Properly close the connection\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Socket Creation**: \n",
    "   - Creates a new TCP socket for network communication\n",
    "   - Uses the `socket.AF_INET` family (IPv4) and `socket.SOCK_STREAM` (TCP) type\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Connection Establishment**:\n",
    "   - Uses the `connect()` method to reach the server at the specified host and port\n",
    "   - Handles potential connection errors (like when the server isn't running)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Exchange**:\n",
    "   - Converts string messages to bytes with `encode('utf-8')` before sending\n",
    "   - Receives response data and converts back to string with `decode('utf-8')`\n",
    "   - Buffers up to 1024 bytes at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cleanup**:\n",
    "   - Uses `finally` block to ensure the socket is always closed\n",
    "   - Prevents resource leaks from lingering connections\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure ensures resources are properly managed even if errors occur."
