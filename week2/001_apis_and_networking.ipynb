    "## A Note on Package Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant equivalent**: Before you can place orders at a restaurant, you need to make sure the restaurant has all the ingredients for the menu items (packages) you want to order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Package Management is Essential\n",
    "\n",
    "Package management is absolutely critical for successful API development and production code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility**: Ensures your code works the same way across different environments\n",
    "2. **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically handles complex package relationships\n",
    "3. **Version Control**: Prevents conflicts between packages with incompatible versions\n",
    "4. **Collaboration**: Makes it easy for team members to run the same code\n",
    "5. **Security**: Helps maintain updated packages with security patches\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we use `uv` - a modern, faster Python package installer and resolver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of `uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed**: Significantly faster than traditional pip (often 10-100x faster)\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Improved dependency resolution with fewer conflicts\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Precise version locking for consistent environments\n",
    "- **Compatibility**: Works with existing requirements files and pyproject.toml\n",
    "\n",
    "### First: Sync Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**: Always sync your virtual environment with the latest project dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run this in your terminal before starting work\n",
    "uv pip sync pyproject.toml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command:\n",
    "- Updates all packages to match versions in the project configuration (ensures the kitchen has the right ingredients)\n",
    "- Installs any new dependencies that were added since you last worked (stocks up on new ingredients)\n",
    "- Removes packages no longer needed by the project (clears out expired ingredients)\n",
    "- Ensures everyone has the same development environment (all chefs work with the same ingredients)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Management Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DO NOT** install packages using `!pip install` in notebooks\n",
    "   - This only installs to the current kernel (like buying ingredients just for one meal)\n",
    "   - Changes are not persistent across project (ingredients disappear after dinner)\n",
    "   - Can lead to inconsistencies (different chefs using different ingredients)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DO** install packages using `uv` in your terminal:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   uv pip install package_name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This properly updates your project's inventory (adds to the restaurant's permanent stock)\n",
    "   - Ensures consistency across the project (all chefs use the same ingredients)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need More Help?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more details on Python package management, refer to [Week 1 materials](../week1/week1_python_basics.ipynb)\n",
    "- Ask ChatGPT: \"How does uv package manager work in Python?\" or \"Explain Python virtual environments\"\n",
    "- Check out [uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for advanced features"

    "## 1. Understanding APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a contract between different software components. Think of it as a waiter in a restaurant:\n",
    "- You (the client) don't need to know how the kitchen (the server) works\n",
    "- You just need to know how to place an order (make a request)\n",
    "- The waiter (API) handles communication between you and the kitchen\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common API Terms:\n",
    "- **Endpoint**: The URL where an API can be accessed\n",
    "- **Request**: What you send to the API\n",
    "- **Response**: What the API sends back\n",
    "- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.\n",
    "- **Status Codes**: 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Role of JSON in APIs <a id=\"json-role\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the primary language that modern APIs use to communicate. It's like the common language that both you and the restaurant staff understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant equivalent**: JSON is like the standard menu format that makes it easy for both customers and kitchen staff to understand orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of JSON in APIs:\n",
    "- **Data Format**: JSON provides a standardized way to structure data (similar to Python dictionaries and lists)\n",
    "- **Human-Readable**: Unlike binary formats, JSON is easy for humans to read and debug\n",
    "- **Language Independent**: Works across programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)\n",
    "- **Lightweight**: Adds minimal overhead to API requests and responses\n",
    "- **Flexible**: Can represent complex nested data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical JSON response from an API looks like:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"id\": 1,\n",
    "  \"title\": \"Our Special Dish\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"A delicious specialty\",\n",
    "  \"price\": 12.99,\n",
    "  \"available\": true,\n",
    "  \"ingredients\": [\"tomato\", \"basil\", \"mozzarella\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the `json` module to:\n",
    "- **Parse JSON responses**: Convert JSON strings to Python dictionaries/lists with `json.loads()`\n",
    "- **Create JSON requests**: Convert Python objects to JSON strings with `json.dumps()`\n",

    "## 2. Making Different Types of HTTP Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs use different HTTP methods for different operations, similar to how a waiter handles different types of requests in a restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GET**: Retrieve data (Like asking the waiter \"What's today's special?\")\n",
    "- **POST**: Create new data (Like ordering a new dish: \"I'd like the pasta, please.\")\n",
    "- **PUT/PATCH**: Update existing data (Like modifying an order: \"Could I get that pasta with chicken instead?\") \n",
    "- **DELETE**: Remove data (Like canceling an order: \"I'd like to cancel the dessert, please.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON in API Requests and Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "For each HTTP method, JSON plays a specific role:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GET requests**: JSON is typically only in the response (the data you receive)\n",
    "- **POST/PUT requests**: JSON is used in both the request body (the data you send) and the response\n",
    "- **All responses**: Most modern APIs return data in JSON format, with appropriate HTTP status codes\n",

    "### Why Authentication and User Tracking Matter:\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Personalization**: The restaurant remembers your preferences (customized user experience)\n",
    "- **Order Attribution**: Knowing who ordered what (associating data with specific users)\n",
    "- **Loyalty Programs**: Regular customers get benefits (premium API features for subscribers)\n",
    "- **Data Privacy**: Protecting customer information (secure handling of user data)\n",

    "- **Order History**: The restaurant tracks your past orders for quicker reordering\n",
    "- **Preference Learning**: \"The usual, sir?\" - Systems learn your preferences over time\n",
    "- **Loyalty Rewards**: Frequent customers get special discounts or faster service\n",
    "- **Personalized Recommendations**: \"Based on your taste profile, you might enjoy our new dish\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Privacy Responsibilities**:\n",
    "- **Data Minimization**: Only collect what you need (\"We only ask for your name, not your life story\")\n",
    "- **Secure Storage**: Encrypt sensitive information (\"Your credit card is stored in our secure safe\")\n",
    "- **Clear Policies**: Transparent data usage (\"Here's how we use your information\")\n",
    "- **User Control**: Allow data access and deletion (\"You can review or remove your information anytime\")\n",
    "- **Compliance**: Follow regulations like GDPR, CCPA (\"We follow restaurant industry standards for customer privacy\")\n",

    "- Credentials\n",
    "- Database connection strings\n",
    "- Server configurations\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Improves security by keeping sensitive data out of code (credit card stays in your wallet)\n",
    "   - Allows different settings across environments (different preferences at different restaurants)\n",

    "2. **Use different variables for different environments** (Different procedures for take-out vs. dine-in)\n",
    "3. **Document required environment variables** in your project's README (Train staff on what customer information they need to collect)\n",
    "4. **Add `.env` files to your `.gitignore`** to prevent accidental commits (Keep customer information in a locked drawer, not on public display)\n",
    "5. **Use strong encryption** for sensitive values in production (Use a secure safe for storing customer payment details)\n",
    "6. **Implement validation** to ensure required variables exist before running critical code (Verify you have all needed information before processing an order)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The .env.example Pattern [OPTIONAL]\n",
    "\n",
    "One best practice we're using in this project is the `.env.example` pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a template file** (`.env.example`) with all required variables but dummy values\n",
    "2. **Commit this template** to version control as documentation\n",
    "3. **Never commit actual `.env` files** with real values\n",
    "4. **Instruct new developers** to copy the example and add their own values:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cp .env.example .env\n",
    "   # Then edit .env with real values\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that:\n",
    "- New team members can easily see what environment variables are needed\n",
    "- No sensitive information is exposed in version control\n",
    "- Configuration requirements are well-documented\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment variables are a powerful tool for API development, allowing you to:\n",
    "- Keep sensitive credentials secure\n",
    "- Change configuration without modifying code\n",
    "- Support different environments (dev, staging, production)\n",
