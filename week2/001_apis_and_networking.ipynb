    "# Python for Learning AI Week 2: APIs and Web Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 2 of our Python development series! This week, we'll dive into working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in Python. By the end of this session, you'll understand how to interact with web services, handle API responses, and build robust API integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant Metaphor**: Throughout this notebook, we'll compare APIs to a restaurant experience:\n",
    "- The API is like a restaurant kitchen (the backend)\n",
    "- You (the client) are a customer placing orders\n",
    "- Your API requests are like ordering from a menu\n",
    "- The waiter is the intermediary handling your requests\n",
    "- API responses are like the food being delivered to your table\n",
    "\n",
    "This metaphor will help make abstract API concepts more concrete and relatable!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "1. Understanding APIs and their role in modern software\n",
    "2. Making HTTP requests with Python's `requests` library\n",
    "3. Working with REST APIs and JSON data\n",
    "4. Handling API authentication and errors\n",
    "5. Building a simple API client\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Basic Python knowledge ([covered in Week 1](../week1/week1_python_basics.ipynb))\n",
    "- Understanding of dictionaries and JSON\n",
    "- Familiarity with functions and error handling\n",

    "## A Note on Package Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant equivalent**: Before you can place orders at a restaurant, you need to make sure the restaurant has all the ingredients for the menu items (packages) you want to order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Package Management is Essential\n",
    "\n",
    "Package management is absolutely critical for successful API development and production code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reproducibility**: Ensures your code works the same way across different environments\n",
    "2. **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically handles complex package relationships\n",
    "3. **Version Control**: Prevents conflicts between packages with incompatible versions\n",
    "4. **Collaboration**: Makes it easy for team members to run the same code\n",
    "5. **Security**: Helps maintain updated packages with security patches\n",
    "\n",
    "For this course, we use `uv` - a modern, faster Python package installer and resolver.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of `uv`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed**: Significantly faster than traditional pip (often 10-100x faster)\n",
    "- **Reliability**: Improved dependency resolution with fewer conflicts\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Precise version locking for consistent environments\n",
    "- **Compatibility**: Works with existing requirements files and pyproject.toml\n",
    "\n",
    "### First: Sync Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**: Always sync your virtual environment with the latest project dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run this in your terminal before starting work\n",
    "uv pip sync pyproject.toml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command:\n",
    "- Updates all packages to match versions in the project configuration (ensures the kitchen has the right ingredients)\n",
    "- Installs any new dependencies that were added since you last worked (stocks up on new ingredients)\n",
    "- Removes packages no longer needed by the project (clears out expired ingredients)\n",
    "- Ensures everyone has the same development environment (all chefs work with the same ingredients)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Management Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DO NOT** install packages using `!pip install` in notebooks\n",
    "   - This only installs to the current kernel (like buying ingredients just for one meal)\n",
    "   - Changes are not persistent across project (ingredients disappear after dinner)\n",
    "   - Can lead to inconsistencies (different chefs using different ingredients)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DO** install packages using `uv` in your terminal:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   uv pip install package_name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This properly updates your project's inventory (adds to the restaurant's permanent stock)\n",
    "   - Ensures consistency across the project (all chefs use the same ingredients)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Need More Help?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more details on Python package management, refer to [Week 1 materials](../week1/week1_python_basics.ipynb)\n",
    "- Ask ChatGPT: \"How does uv package manager work in Python?\" or \"Explain Python virtual environments\"\n",
    "- Check out [uv documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for advanced features"

    "- Credentials\n",
    "- Database connection strings\n",
    "- Server configurations\n",
    "\n",

    "- Your membership card or loyalty number (API keys)\n",
    "- Your reservation confirmation (authentication tokens)\n",
    "- Your credit card details (credentials)\n",
    "- Your preferred table location (connection settings)\n",
    "- Your dietary restrictions (configuration)\n",

    "\n",
    "Environment variables are key-value pairs that exist outside your application code. They're an ideal solution for managing configuration:\n",

    "   - Improves security by keeping sensitive data out of code (credit card stays in your wallet)\n",
    "   - Allows different settings across environments (different preferences at different restaurants)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Common Python libraries:**\n",
    "   - `os` (built-in): Basic environment variable access\n",

    "In production environments, environment variables are typically set differently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cloud Platforms:**\n",
    "   - AWS: Parameter Store, Secrets Manager\n",
    "   - Azure: App Configuration, Key Vault\n",
    "   - Google Cloud: Secret Manager\n",
    "   - Heroku: Config Vars\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Container Environments:**\n",
    "   - Docker: Environment variables in Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml\n",
    "   - Kubernetes: ConfigMaps and Secrets\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CI/CD Systems:**\n",
    "   - GitHub Actions: Repository secrets\n",
    "   - Jenkins: Credentials plugin\n",
    "   - GitLab CI: CI/CD variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant equivalent**: These are like the restaurant's policies for handling customer information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Never hardcode sensitive information** in your code or commit it to repositories (Don't write customer credit card numbers on napkins)\n",
    "2. **Use different variables for different environments** (Different procedures for take-out vs. dine-in)\n",
    "3. **Document required environment variables** in your project's README (Train staff on what customer information they need to collect)\n",
    "4. **Add `.env` files to your `.gitignore`** to prevent accidental commits (Keep customer information in a locked drawer, not on public display)\n",
    "5. **Use strong encryption** for sensitive values in production (Use a secure safe for storing customer payment details)\n",
    "6. **Implement validation** to ensure required variables exist before running critical code (Verify you have all needed information before processing an order)\n",

    "\n",
    "Environment variables are a powerful tool for API development, allowing you to:\n",
    "- Keep sensitive credentials secure\n",
    "- Change configuration without modifying code\n",
    "- Support different environments (dev, staging, production)\n",
    "- Follow security best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**Restaurant equivalent**: Just as a restaurant needs systems to manage customer preferences, payment details, and location-specific information securely, APIs need environment variables to handle configuration and sensitive data across different contexts."
